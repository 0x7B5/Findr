An app that streamlines the process of deciding upon a resturant to eat at or a movie to watch with a significant other. Provides a Tinder-like swiping interface where two people can swipe through movies/resturants until they match on one. This project served as my submission for the HackRice X hackathon.

## Problem 
Deciding on a movie to watch or resturant to eat at doesn't seem like that big of a problem at first glance. But a [2017 study](https://nypost.com/2017/11/17/american-couples-spend-5-5-days-a-year-deciding-what-to-eat/) that polled 2000 Americans concluded that the average American couple speends 132 hours a year deciding what to eat. Furthermore, the average Netflix user spends an average [18 minutes](https://www.indiewire.com/2016/07/netflix-decide-watch-studies-1201708634/) trying to decide what to watch. 

This app aims to decrease those numbers substansially.
